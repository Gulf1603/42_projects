step ? :
Pushing elements to stack B by using every func except pa
The objective if to push the elements to B but giving it some order,
like starting to minimize the most possible the difference between different elements of the stack B

step ? :
Pushing elements to stack A by giving differents commands :
	pa
	ra
	rra
	rb
	rrb
	rr
	rrr
	sb
	sa
The objective is to try to see which is the easiest number to push to A, and see if the ones next to it are near it too.
Minimizing the number of actions to push an element and maximazing the newly found neighbors. For exemple
	A : 3 -> 5
	B : 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6
In this situation, should push 4 to a, so we can then push 2 and 1
