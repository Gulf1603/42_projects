Ok so I think I will create test like this :

int	test(char **instruction)
{
	[code that mimics the action of the instruction given]
	return (result)
}


where the instructions would be an array of string, such as :
{"sa", "pa", ...}
and result would be something like the difference between the values of the list, or how much the list has been sorted
